# simple-counter-WA-RUST
This is my very first approach to Rust and WebAssembly, in this simple project I've implemented TailwindCss for styling. (For clarification purposes: I'm totally new in this field(WA,RUST,TailwindCss)  )


steps to run it:

1. Follow the Yew Getting Started guide - https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction
2. Run ```npm install```
3. After that you have to run the next (dev mode) ```npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./output.css --watch ```
4. And finally ```trunk serve``` to compile the WA
